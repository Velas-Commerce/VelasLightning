<h1>The Client library</h1>

<p>the client library can be included in any swift project.  The VelasLightning Framework is packaged as an xcFramework.</p>

<p>the client library uses the LDK and BDK to turn you application into a lightweight lightning node.</p>

<p>included in the repo is an example project that shows how to include and use the client library into a iOS application. <a href="https://github.com/diegovelascommerce/VelasLightning/tree/main/VelasLightningExample">Velas Lightning Example Project</a></p>

<p>here are some videos demoing how the Velas Lightning Example Project works
   - <a href="demo_create_channel.mp4">demo open channel</a>
   - <a href="VelasLightningInvoiceDemo.mp4">demo paying an invoice</a>
   - <a href="demo_close_channels.mp4">demo closing channel</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>this project is for demo purposes <em>only</em>.  The client is directly communicating with the REST/LAPP interface which we do not recommend.  it&#39;s not a good idea to give people an idea on where your money is located.  Also there is some information that is returned from the LAPP that you may want to record and associate with your client&#39;s account information in the backend.  Such as the nodeId to their lighting wallet and channel_points to their channels.  Also the test server for the LAPP is using a self signed certificate.  Apple might reject apps that communicate with a backend that is not signed by a certified certificate authority like VeriSign, GoDaddy, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>rather we recommend that all communication from the client to the LAPP is done through a proxy.  that way the actual location of the remote lighting is not as easily discernable and lightning critical information about the client can be recorded in the backend and associated with your clients.  Also you can just use the TLS/SSL certificate you have setup in your backend for encrypted communication between your app and backend.</p></li>
<li><p>here is an illustration of the ideal way to have the client communicate with the REST API/LAPP

<h1>Get started using VelasFramework</h1>

<p>once the VelasLightningFramework is properly included in your project,
include it to get access to the Velas class</p>

<p><code>swift
import VelasLightningFramework
</code></p>

<p>the Velas Class is how you will interact with the lightning network.
Its as global static class with public memembers that allows you to interact with the lightning network.</p>

<p>before you can start using it, you need to login and obtain the jwt token to where you will have access to the endpoints for lightning communication.</p>

<p>```swift</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1><a href="https://github.com/diegovelascommerce/VelasLightning/blob/main/VelasLightningFramework/VelasLightningFramework/Velas.swift">Velas Class</a>:</h1>

<p>the client will be interacting with the lighting network through a class called <a href="https://github.com/diegovelascommerce/VelasLightning/blob/7cec361affe799d883b0ac9afa6ad4f93c2701ed/VelasLightningFramework/VelasLightningFramework/Velas.swift#L7">Velas</a>.</p>

<p>Since starting up a lightning node does take sometime because the state of the channels, peers and transactions must be synced and verified,  it is recommended to initialize the Velas class in the same startup method as your application. For example, in the AppDelegate of an iOS project.</p>
